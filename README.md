MSci Project: "Electronic Structure of Covalent Organic Frameworks"

For my final year MSci project, I will be investigating and designing computational models of the electronic structure of Covaent Organic Frameworks (COFs). Discovered in 2005, the possible applications of this type of porous crystalline polymers include energy storage, optoelectronics, solar cells... A main difference between COFs and other polymers is that COFs allow us to design them completely in 2D or 3D. This is because they consist of building blocks bonded covalently. 

Probing their electronic structure through DFT methods will allow me to investigate the charge transport observed in different COFs. However, I am particularly interested in Porphyrin COFs, due to their high conductivity.
